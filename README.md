# Manuel Sexto - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About

Hello, I'm Manuel!  I have an academic background in Business and currently, I am currently completing my Master's in Business Intelligence in First of all thank you for your time and your interest in my portfolio this documetn will guide you through it.

This portfolio showcases my experience as a Data Analyst, organized by the tools and technologies I've mastered. Each section highlights projects and professional work, providing details about the objectives, methodologies, and results achieved.

Each section is dedicated to a specific tool or platform (e.g., Python, R, Power BI).
You can find a brief description of each project, including:
Objectives and challenges
Key methodologies or techniques applied
Outcomes and key insights
Feel free to explore each section and learn more about my journey as a data professional!

## **Portfolio Proyects**



## SQL

- ### [Ecommerce](https://github.com/ManuSexto/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/SQL/Code_Ecommerce.sql)

In this proyect I created the data [Ecommerce Database](https://github.com/ManuSexto/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/SQL/Database%20ECommerce.sql) using SQL, from the database  [Adventureworks2017](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms) and using this data I have resolved different consultative queries, defined in the code itself, about different aspects of the database.

**Data:** [Ecommerce Database](https://github.com/ManuSexto/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/SQL/Database%20ECommerce.sql)

**Code:** [Ecommerce Code](https://github.com/ManuSexto/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/SQL/Code_Ecommerce.sql)

 - ### [AdventureWorks2017](https://github.com/ManuSexto/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/SQL/AdventureWorks2017_1.sql)

This proyect ranges from global and regional sales analysis to the creation of detailed datasets for predictive modeling (linear and logistic regression). Queries were built to extract, transform, and consolidate relevant data from multiple tables, optimizing the organization and preparation of information for future analysis or visualizations.

## R


- ### [Clustering AW17](https://github.com/ManuSexto/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/R/AW17%20Clustering.R)

This project began with data preparation, which included cleaning the dataset and addressing anomalies in the sales column. Once the data was ready, an analysis was conducted to answer key questions and explore its characteristics. The K-means algorithm was selected for clustering, and after determining the optimal number of clusters, the results were interpreted and visualized to identify meaningful patterns and validate their quality.

**Code:** [AW17 Clustering](https://github.com/ManuSexto/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/R/AW17%20Clustering.R)



- ### [Predictions,Logistic regresion and decision tree](https://github.com/ManuSexto/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/R/Dataset%20SQL%20AW17.R)

The goal of this project was to develop a model capable of predicting whether an individual would make a purchase, utilizing two distinct approaches: logistic regression and decision tree algorithms. The process began with thorough data cleaning and analysis, followed by splitting the dataset into training and validation subsets. The models were then trained, and their accuracy was evaluated. Additionally, unsupervised learning techniques were applied to identify different customer typologies, segmenting the dataset into two clusters for further analysis and interpretation.
