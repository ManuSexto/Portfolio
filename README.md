## **Portfolio Proyects**

## SQL

- ### Ecommerce

In this proyect I created the data [Ecommerce Database](https://github.com/ManuSexto/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/SQL/Database%20ECommerce.sql) using SQL, from the database  [Adventureworks2017](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms) and using this data I have resolved different consultative queries, defined in the code itself, about different aspects of the database.

**Data:** [Ecommerce Database](https://github.com/ManuSexto/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/SQL/Database%20ECommerce.sql)

**Code:** [Ecommerce Code](https://github.com/ManuSexto/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/SQL/Code_Ecommerce.sql)

 - ### [AdventureWorks2017](https://github.com/ManuSexto/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/SQL/AdventureWorks2017_1.sql)

This proyect ranges from global and regional sales analysis to the creation of detailed datasets for predictive modeling (linear and logistic regression). Queries were built to extract, transform, and consolidate relevant data from multiple tables, optimizing the organization and preparation of information for future analysis or visualizations.

## R

- ### [Clustering AW17](https://github.com/ManuSexto/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/R/AW17%20Clustering.R)

This proyect started with the  preparation of  the data, once it was clean and the spikes in the sells colums were treated, it was time to analyze the data by answering certain questions about it. After the analysis and I slected the algorithm K-means for th clustering. Once the optimal number of clusters is determined, the results are interpreted and visualized to uncover meaningful patterns and validate their quality.
