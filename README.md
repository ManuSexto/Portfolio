# Manuel Sexto - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About

Hello, I'm Manuel!
I have an academic background in Business and am currently completing my Master's in Business Intelligence. First of all, thank you for taking the time and showing interest in my portfolioâ€”this repossitory is designed to guide you through it.

Each section is dedicated to a specific tool or platform (e.g., Python, R, Power BI).
You can find a brief description of each project, including:
Objectives and challenges
Key methodologies or techniques applied
Outcomes and key insights

Feel free to explore each section and learn more about my journey as a data professional!

## **Portfolio Projects**



## SQL

- ### [Ecommerce](https://github.com/ManuSexto/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/SQL/Code_Ecommerce.sql)

In this proyect I created the data [Ecommerce Database](https://github.com/ManuSexto/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/SQL/Database%20ECommerce.sql) using SQL, from the database  [Adventureworks2017](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms) and using this data I have resolved different consultative queries, defined in the code itself, about different aspects of the database.

**Data:** [Ecommerce Database](https://github.com/ManuSexto/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/SQL/Database%20ECommerce.sql)

**Code:** [Ecommerce Code](https://github.com/ManuSexto/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/SQL/Code_Ecommerce.sql)

 - ### [AdventureWorks2017](https://github.com/ManuSexto/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/SQL/AdventureWorks2017_1.sql)

This proyect ranges from global and regional sales analysis to the creation of detailed datasets for predictive modeling (linear and logistic regression). Queries were built to extract, transform, and consolidate relevant data from multiple tables, optimizing the organization and preparation of information for future analysis or visualizations.

**Data:** [Adventureworks2017](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms)

## R


- ### [Clustering AW17](https://github.com/ManuSexto/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/R/AW17%20Clustering.R)

This project began with data preparation, which included cleaning the dataset and addressing anomalies in the sales column. Once the data was ready, an analysis was conducted to answer key questions and explore its characteristics. The K-means algorithm was selected for clustering, and after determining the optimal number of clusters, the results were interpreted and visualized to identify meaningful patterns and validate their quality.

**Data:** [Dataset AW17 Clustering](R/dataset_AW_Clustering.xlsx)


**Code:** [AW17 Clustering](https://github.com/ManuSexto/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/R/AW17%20Clustering.R)



- ### [Predictions,Logistic regresion and decision tree](https://github.com/ManuSexto/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/R/Dataset%20SQL%20AW17.R)

The goal of this project was to develop a model capable of predicting whether an individual would make a purchase, utilizing two distinct approaches: logistic regression and decision tree algorithms. The process began with thorough data cleaning and analysis, followed by splitting the dataset into training and validation subsets. The models were then trained, and their accuracy was evaluated. Additionally, unsupervised learning techniques were applied to identify different customer typologies, segmenting the dataset into two clusters for further analysis and interpretation.

**Code:** [SQL AW17 ](https://github.com/ManuSexto/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/R/SQL%20AW17.R)


- ### [Analyzing University enrollments](https://github.com/ManuSexto/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/R/University_Data.R)

This project focused on analyzing a dataset containing enrollment information for various master's and bachelor's programs at diferent universities. The analysis included identifying trends such as the Top 30 universities with the most enrolled students and the Top 30 degrees with the highest percentage of women. To enhance data interpretation, visualizations were created for all key insights, enabling a clear and comprehensive understanding of enrollment patterns and preferences.

## Python


-### [Analysis and clustering AW](https://github.com/ManuSexto/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Python/dataset_AW_%20Clustering.xlsx)


This project focused on analyzing a database to extract meaningful insights through visualizations and clustering techniques. Initially, the data was cleaned and prepared for analysis to ensure accuracy and consistency. Key performance indicators and trends were identified using a variety of graphs, such as bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps, which allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

After the exploratory analysis, clustering techniques were applied to uncover hidden patterns and segment the data into distinct groups. The K-means algorithm was chosen, and the optimal number of clusters was determined through appropriate metrics. The resulting clusters were then interpreted and visualized to provide actionable insights, facilitating data-driven decision-making.
